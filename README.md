# crawler

A simple web crawler limited to one domain. E.g. when you start with https://monzo.com/, it would crawl all pages within monzo.com, but not follow external links, for example to the Facebook and Twitter accounts. Given a URL, it should print a simple site map, showing the links between pages.
